### join samples

### INNER JOIN
(only common in both tables)

`Query`
```sql
SELECT e.name AS emp_name, d.name AS dept_name FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
```

| emp_name | dept_name |
| -------- | --------- |
| Raj 1    | Production |

m.name AS manager_name, p.name AS project_name 
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
JOIN managers m ON e.manager_id = m.id
JOIN projects p ON e.project_id = p.id
```

### FULL JOIN
(everything from both table) (inner + left + right)

`Query`
```sql
SELECT e.name AS emp_name, d.name AS dept_name FROM employees e FULL JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
```

`Response`

### CROSS JOIN (Cartesian product)
(no condition required) (each record will associate with other record)

`Query`

```sql
SELECT e.name AS emp_name, d.name AS dept_name FROM employees e CROSS JOIN departments d
```

`Response`
| emp_name | dept_name |
| -------- | --------- |
| Raj 1    | Production    |

| Vasanth  | Develepment   |
| Mari     | Develepment   |

<br />
in above example we have, 4 employees and 7 depts so we got 28 record.


### NATURAL JOIN
(no condition required) (condition will be set by sql) (try to avoid this join)

`Query`

```sql
SELECT e.name AS emp_name, d.name AS dept_name FROM employees e NATURAL JOIN departments d
```

`Response`
| emp_name | dept_name |
| -------- | --------- |

got empty res []

<br />
<br />

New table added to demonstrate self join named `families`.

`families`
```sql
families (
  id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
  parent_id BIGSERIAL
);
```

#### Data samples for families

| id | name | parent_id |
| -- | ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Raj    | null |
| 2 | Kumar  | null |
| 3 | Ashok  | 1    |
| 4 | Vikram | 1    |
